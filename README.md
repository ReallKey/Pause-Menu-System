# Pause-Menu-System
I created a Pause Menu System inside my starter 2d platformer that would let the player pause the game when needed and take a break. This system includes a home button that will switch the scene to your "MainMenu", A resume button so you can start playing again, and a setting button 

Ive just started in my first project in unity. Im trying to learn as much as possible, so  that I can grow and become better at game devolopment. Any suggestions and or comments would be great
